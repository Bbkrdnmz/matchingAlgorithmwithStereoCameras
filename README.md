## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python matching.py
```

```bash
python test.py
```

### Perform Calibration
```bash
python stereoCalibration1.py
```

## üîß Configuration

### Camera Settings
```python
# Camera IDs (check with test.py)
cap_left = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_MSMF)
cap_right = cv2.VideoCapture(1, cv2.CAP_MSMF)

# Resolution settings
cap_left.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 1920)
cap_left.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 720)
```

### Model Path
```python
# Specify your model path here
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom',
                       path=r'C:\Users\donme\Desktop\MachingAlg\best.pt', force_reload=True)
```

## üìä Output Format

### Left Camera
- Green bounding boxes
- Confidence scores (top)
- Object IDs (bottom)
- Total plank count (top-left corner)

### Right Camera
- Green bounding boxes
- Confidence scores (top)
- Matched IDs (bottom)
- Unmatched objects marked with "-"

## üîç Algorithm Details

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- Lens distortion correction using camera calibration
- Object detection with YOLOv5
- Confidence threshold (default: 0.5)

### 2. Object Tracking
- ID assignment using DeepSORT algorithm on left camera
- `max_age=100` parameter for long-term tracking
- Centroid-based matching

### 3. Stereo Matching
- IoU (Intersection over Union) calculation
- Centroid distance calculation
- Greedy algorithm for best match selection
- One-to-one mapping (each ID used only once)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Opening
```bash
# Check camera IDs
python test.py
```

### Model Not Loading
- Ensure `best.pt` file is in correct location
- Check PyTorch and YOLOv5 installation

### Calibration Error
- Check if `stereo_calibration_data.xml` exists
- Repeat calibration process

### ID Instability
- Adjust DeepSORT parameters (`max_age`, `max_iou_distance`)
- Check camera calibration accuracy

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### GPU Usage
```python
# Enable CUDA usage
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)
```

### FPS Improvement
- Increase confidence threshold (0.7-0.8)
- Reduce image resolution
- Optimize DeepSORT parameters

## üìñ Description

This project implements a real-time stereo vision system for plank detection and tracking in industrial environments. The system uses two synchronized USB cameras to capture stereo images, applies camera calibration to correct lens distortions, and employs YOLOv5 for object detection. The key innovation lies in the stereo matching algorithm that ensures the same plank detected in the left camera is correctly identified and matched in the right camera, preventing confusion between different planks.

The system features persistent object tracking using DeepSORT, which maintains stable IDs even when planks move or are temporarily occluded. The stereo matching process uses both IoU (Intersection over Union) and centroid distance calculations to achieve accurate one-to-one mapping between cameras. Real-time visualization displays confidence scores, unique IDs, and a running count of detected planks.

This solution is particularly useful for quality control, inventory management, and automated sorting systems in wood processing facilities where accurate plank identification and tracking are critical for operational efficiency.
